# GNDEC Academic Portfolio: Computer Science & Engineering

This repository serves as a personal academic portfolio, showcasing a collection of my coursework, lab practicals, and projects from my studies in Computer Science & Engineering at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC).

## About This Repository

The primary goal of this repository is to document my learning journey and provide a practical reference for the concepts and skills I've acquired. It's a living collection of my work, reflecting my growth as a student and a developer. The code within this repository is intended to be a resource for fellow students and anyone interested in learning more about the subjects covered.

## Subjects and Coursework

This repository is organized by subject, with each directory containing relevant code, assignments, and practicals.

### Database Management Systems (DBMS)
*   **Directory:** `GNDEC-DBMS/`
*   **Description:** This section contains C++ implementations of fundamental DBMS concepts. You'll find examples of data structures and algorithms used in database systems.

### Digital Circuits and Logic Design (DCLD)
*   **Directory:** `GNDEC-DCLD/`
*   **Description:** This section includes C++ programs that simulate and explore concepts in digital logic design, such as logic gates and circuits.

### Data Structures (DS)
*   **Directory:** `GNDEC-DS/`
*   **Description:** A collection of C++ programs implementing various data structures and algorithms, including sorting, searching, and more. This section is a practical guide to the building blocks of efficient software.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)
*   **Directory:** `GNDEC-OOPS/`
*   **Description:** This section features C++ programs that demonstrate key OOPS principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. It's a practical exploration of object-oriented design patterns.

### Probability and Statistics (PAS)
*   **Directory:** `GNDEC-PAS/`
*   **Description:** Python scripts for various statistical analyses and probability concepts. This section showcases the application of Python in solving statistical problems.

## How to Learn from This Repository

You are encouraged to explore the code, learn from the implementations, and even try to improve upon them. Here's how you can get started:

### C++ Programs
To compile and run the C++ programs, you'll need a C++ compiler like g++.
```bash
g++ <filename>.cpp -o <output_filename>
./<output_filename>
```

### Python Scripts
To run the Python scripts, you'll need Python 3 installed.
```bash
python3 <filename>.py
```

## Contributing to the Learning

This repository is a personal project, but contributions and suggestions are always welcome. If you have a better solution to a problem, find a bug, or want to add more examples, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Let's learn together!
